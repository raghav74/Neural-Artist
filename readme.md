GanDraw-Tries to draw 10 classes\
GanDraw1Class-Can draw only one class(apple), but generates better doodles\
The saved model in models is for GanDraw1Class\
Run 'pip install -r requirements.txt' first to install necessary packages.\
Install tensorflow if needed.\
IMPORTANT-\
Run download() only once and then comment the function out, otherwise will waste data in redownloading the quick draw dataset.\
Also, ignore the code with assert GPU etc.,its just to test of tensorflow GPU is being used
